# HUMM Azure & Databrick & ADLS & Spark & Scala

##  Purpose
Because of cooked rices, clothes, rices and money

## First things first, go to microsoft hell
- Registering Microsoft Azure, free trial account (Master,Visa cards)
- Try anything that you feel confident (all very complex and stressful) - [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), [Azure Cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) ...
- Create ADLS gen2, Databricks (hope you can do it)

## Another hell in paradise
Download or try to beg your mentor to help you on those: 
- Use a cool IDE (seem your only choice is Intellij IDEA)
- Install Azure Plugin
- Install SBT Tool plugin
- Install Scala Plugin

Oh my, cool, create new Azure Spark Scala project with those:

- sbt: 0.13.18 (yes, it was past present and future of us - shit still be shit whenever we touch).
    
    - well, why, because MS guys at databrick don't have time to migrate or upgrade anything outside their project 
- scala: 2.11.12
- spark: 2.4.0 - 6

    - i'm using .0, too lazy to change to .6, so not sure about .6

>Remember that any changes in 3rd versions will causes you can't build, import project ... lot of shitty things
